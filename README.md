# RSP2-Final
An assortment of supplementary data and scripts.

- MASTERS-ACTIVITY-LOG-DAILY.xlsx is a very, VERY long relatively informal documentation of what I worked on, per day.

SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

- CDS extraction contains coding sequences extracted per species.  
- FinalAlignments contains the finalized, cleaned and trimmed codon alignments that were to be used in datamonkey, all default settings.  
- NegativelySelectedResidues contains the FUBAR outputs in the form of an excel spreadsheet.  
- Scripts contains all scripts used within this paper, including a handful of plotting scripts.  
- Working Models contains all alphafold/haddock models generated. This further includes a number of models that did not make it into the paper due to limitations (e.g., Candidozyma auris models).  
- p2rank contains all p2rank estimated active sites that were then used with haddock.  
- caPUL3translation.fasta is a single file containing all translated Candidozyma auris Pul3 proteins, to highlight the fact they are all pseudogenized.
