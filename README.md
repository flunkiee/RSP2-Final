# RSP2-Final
An assortment of supplementary data and scripts.

MASTERS-ACTIVITY-LOG-DAILY.xlsx is a very, VERY long relatively informal documentation of what I worked on, per day. 

SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
├── CDS extraction
│   └── contains coding sequences extracted per species
├── FinalAlignments
│   └── contains the finalized, cleaned and trimmed codon alignments that were to be used in datamonkey, all default settings
├── NegativelySelectedResidues
│   └── contains the FUBAR outputs in the form of an Excel spreadsheet
├── Scripts
│   └── contains all scripts used within this paper, including a handful of plotting scripts
├── Working Models
│   └── contains all alphafold/haddock models generated, including some models that did not make it into the paper due to limitations (e.g., Candidozyma auris models)
├── p2rank
│   └── contains all p2rank estimated active sites that were then used with haddock
└── caPUL3translation.fasta
    └── a single file containing all translated Candidozyma auris Pul3 proteins, highlighting the fact they are all pseudogenized
